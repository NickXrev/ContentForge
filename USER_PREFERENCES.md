# User Preferences

## Communication Style
- User wants me to find a middle ground between being too cautious and too aggressive
- When user says "yes" or "do it", proceed without asking for confirmation again
- Stop asking for permission after user has already given it
- Be more decisive and action-oriented while still being thoughtful
- User gets frustrated when I ask for permission after they've already given it

## Credit Usage
- User has $20 in Perplexity credits
- Use credits sparingly
- Test code changes first without API calls when possible
- Be strategic about when to run expensive research
